## Questions

1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?

When calling a new model, it creates the object but does not save it until it is used. On the otherhand, create a model will save it to the database once it has been created. 

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?

Save method will do the same. 

3. What is the default integer column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?

name 

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?

cat = Cat.create name: "hat"

5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?

Slightly better because I am starting to understand the concepts a little more. However, it has nothing to do with the HW itself, but my personal understanding.
